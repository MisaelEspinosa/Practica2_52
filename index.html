    <pre>What we're living in?
        Lemme tell ya
        Yeah, it's a wonder man can eat at all
        When things are big that should be small
        Who can Tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
        And I'm giving all my love to this world
        Only to be told
        I can't see, I can't breathe
        No more will we be
        And nothing's gonna change the way we live
        'Cause we can always take, but never give
        And now that things are changing for the worse, see
        Whoa, it's a crazy world we're living in
        And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
        Is all we have to give these
        Futures made of virtual insanity, now
        Always seem to be governed by this love we have
        For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
        Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground
        And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
        Hard to know where to begin
        If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
        And now every mother can choose the color
        Of her child, that's not nature's way
        Well, that's what they said yesterday
        There's nothing left to do, but pray
        I think it's time to find a new religion
        Whoa, it's so insane
        To synthesize another strain
        There's something in these futures
        That we have to be told
        Futures made of virtual insanity, now
        Always seem to be governed by this love we have
        For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
        Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground, wow
        Now there is no sound
        If we all live underground
        And now it's virtual insanity
        Forget your virtual reality
        Oh, there's nothing so bad
        As a man-made man
        Oh, yeah, I know, yeah (take it to the dance floor)
        I know I can't go on
        Of this virtual insanity we're living in
        Has got to change, yeah
        Things will never be the same
        And I can't go on
        Where we're living in
        Oh, oh, virtual insanity
        Oh, this world
        He's got to change
        'Cause I just
        I just can't keep going on in this virtual, virtual insanity
        That we're living in, that we're living in
        And that virtual insanity is what is, yeah
        Futures made of virtual insanity, now
        Always seem to be governed by this love we have
        For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
        Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground, oh
        Futures made of, now, virtual insanity
        Now we all, we seem to be governed by a love
        For these useless, twisting, of our new technology
        And now there is no sound, for we all live underground
        Yes, we do, oh
        now this life that we live in
        (Virtual insanity) it's all going wrong
        Out of the window (living in)
        Do you know there is nothing worse than (virtual insanity)
        a man-made man
